### About this application
This is a 2D web experience inspired by Aidin Robbins' video Why the World's Tallest Tree is Kept Hidden. The project brings the visuals to life, using Three.js to create a fog effect — a subtle yet immersive entrance that hides the secret surrounding these ancient giants.

By embedding the video via an iframe, the project provides a direct link to the story, allowing users to explore the narrative behind these remarkable giants in a straightforward yet impactful manner.


### Future 3D version
2D version lays as the groundwork for V2 — an upcoming transition to a fully interactive 3D environment.
